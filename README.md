# LinuxFinalHoursOfTitanfall
script to setup the final hours of titanfall on steam to play through proton

**NOTE:** This script assumes you have some programs installed.  Make sure you have the programs "unzip" from your package manager and [protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks) installed!

This has been tested and verified to work with Proton 5.13, however other proton versions should probably work fine too.

### Step 1:
Install the Final Hours of Titanfall on steam.

### Step 2:
Run it once.  It will try and load, then come up with an error box saying "Sorry, an error has occured."  Thats ok.

### Step 3:
Copy the `setup.sh` file from this git repo into the directory the game is installed in.  This folder can be found by right clicking the game on steam, selecting `Properties`, clicking on the `Local Files` section, then clicking `Browse...`

### Step 4:
Run the setup.sh file.  Most of the time you can do this by just double clicking on the file and choosing `Execute` or preferably `Execute in Terminal` so that you can see what it's doing.

### Step 5:
Wait for the script to finish and close out, then the game should be good to play. Try pressing play in steam.
